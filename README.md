# XBufferShield - Advanced Buffer Overflow Protection & Testing Tool

## Overview
XBufferShield is an advanced security tool designed to detect, prevent, and test for buffer overflow vulnerabilities in binaries. It integrates memory protection, anti-debugging mechanisms, and multi-threaded fuzzing techniques to ensure system integrity and security.

## Features
- **Memory Protection**: Prevents stack-based buffer overflows and detects abnormal memory corruption.
- **Advanced Fuzzing**: Sends various payloads to analyze vulnerability points.
- **Stealth Mode**: Bypasses common anti-reverse engineering techniques.
- **Multi-threading**: Optimized for performance with parallel execution.
- **Stack Canary Detection**: Identifies buffer overflow defenses in binaries.

## Installation
To install and use XBufferShield, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yonathanpy/XBufferShield.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd XBufferShield

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the tool
python3 xbuffer_shield.py <target_binary>
```

## Usage
XBufferShield is designed to test compiled binaries for buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Example usage:

```bash
python3 xbuffer_shield.py /path/to/vulnerable_binary
```

### Example Output
```bash
[+] Scanning memory regions...
[+] Fuzzing input buffers...
[*] Possible buffer overflow detected at offset 128
[!] Protection triggered! Stack overflow detected.
```

## Advanced Usage
- **Enable Debug Mode**: `python3 xbuffer_shield.py --debug <binary>`
- **Set Custom Payload Size**: `python3 xbuffer_shield.py --size 512 <binary>`
- **Run in Stealth Mode**: `python3 xbuffer_shield.py --stealth <binary>`
